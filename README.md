# Hyperspectral-Imaging-Data-Assignment

This repository contains a single Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to analyze hyperspectral imaging data, including data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and model training with hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna**.

## Repository Structure

- **`hsi-notebook (1).ipynb`**  
  - Main Jupyter notebook that includes:
    - Data preprocessing (missing data check, outlier removal)
    - Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
    - Model training and hyperparameter tuning (Random Forest, SVR, Gradient Boosting)

## Installation and Dependencies

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Hyperspectral-imaging-data-Assignment.git
